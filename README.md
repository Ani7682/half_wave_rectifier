# half_wave_rectifier
In this project, a HWR (Half Wave Rectifier) is implemented on MATLAB, along with its output waveform and RMS values.

Half-wave rectifiers transform AC voltage to DC voltage. A halfwave rectifier circuit uses only one diode for the transformation. A halfwave rectifier is defined as a type of rectifier that allows only one-half cycle of an AC voltage waveform to pass while blocking the other half cycle.
When the diode is forward-biased, it acts as a closed switch.
When a diode is reverse-biased, it acts as an open switch. Since no current can flow to the load, the output voltage is equal to zero.
